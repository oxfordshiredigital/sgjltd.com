<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FAMILY BUSINESS</h3>

<p>SGJ Limited is a long-established family-owned property development company based in Oxfordshire. Having spent over sixty years developing residential and commercial properties in the south of England it is also now actively involved in strategic land promotion and larger new-build housing schemes. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>60 YEARS TRADING</h3>

<p>The company dates back to 1955 when Stanley Jewson and his brother started developing properties in Oxford whilst at the same time building up the Luxicars and Motorworld car dealerships. In 1984 they sold the Oxford Garage Group motor business (franchises included VW, Audi, Volvo, Saab, Renault, and BMW) to the Co-op whilst retaining the commercial premises they had built and developed. </p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TRACK RECORD</h3>

<p>Since 1984 the brothers continued developing properties, both commercial and residential, and in 1991 the name was changed to SGJ when Stanley went on his own to work with his accountant son Andrew and estate-agent daughter Kate. As well as properties and land in Oxfordshire, SGJ has been involved in schemes in Gloucestershire and the Home Counties, as well as overseas in places including Spain and Turkey (it was the first developer to get Savills to market houses it had built in Turkey).</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PROJECTS </h3>

<p>Current schemes include a 6 acre site in Kent SGJ purchased this year, where is looking to get planning to build 55 houses. Last year it sold a large site in Oxford it owned and had developed, which had a mix of residential and commercial units, to a local college. It also has a few smaller properties and sites it is currently seeking to gain planning on. </p>

<p>With its knowledge of the planning system and it contacts within the building industry, SGJ is actively looking to buy properties with potential where extra planning might be gained. As well as residential sites it also looks at commercial properties.</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LAND PROMOTION </h3>

<p>SGJ is increasingly more involved in identifying strategic off-market land that has potential for residential development. Working with the landowners, this can be by way of either outright purchase, or an option agreement. In an option agreement, an option fee is payable to the land-owner, and then SGJ either handles and pays for the planning process at its own risk within an agreed option period (usually two years), or works with another house-builder to promote the land. SGJ ensures the land-owner gets up to 75% of the full open market value of the land, which can be over £1 million per acre in certain parts of the country.</p>

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CARS </h3>

<p>With a motoring history to the business, SGJ has kept in the motor trade, and for the last 30 years been specialising in the restoration of classic cars, particularly old Jaguars and Ferraris. With the phenomenal increase in classic car prices over the last eight years Andrew says he always knew he should have held on to that 1967 Jaguar E-Type, 1984 Ferrari GTO and aluminium 1965 275 GTB. He is still waiting for prices to come down again…</p>
