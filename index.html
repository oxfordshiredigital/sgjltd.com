				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq1" href="#faq1">Who are SGJ?</a>
				<p id="faq1" class="collapse">We are a fully independent, family owned and run, property company specialising in identifying potential development land and promoting these sites for the landowner. We have over sixty years experience of securing sites, preparing and submitting planning applications and selling land to housing developers.</p>

				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq2" href="#faq2">Is my land suitable for development?</a>
				<p id="faq2" class="collapse">There are lots of different factors that can affect development potential. Location, size and the nature of the surrounding area is important. The Local Council Development Plans and enviromental features such as Green Belt, AONB and Flood Zones can have a major impact on land values. SGJ can advise you about your land without cost or obligation.</p>

				<hr  class="line green3">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq3" href="#faq3">What is my land worth?</a>
				<p id="faq3" class="collapse">Land values can vary from Â£250,000 per acre to over Â£1m per acre depending on location, suitability and potential development use.</p>

				<hr class="line green2">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq4" href="#faq4">What is a Land Promotion Agreement?</a>
				<p id="faq4" class="collapse">A Land Promotion Agreement is an arrangememt whereby SGJ applies for planning permission on behalf of the landowner. SGJ will pay for all the required surveys, design, planning and application costs, at no risk to the landowner. Should the application be successful the proceeds of the sale of the land are split between SGJ and the landowner.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq5" href="#faq5">How do you get Planning?</a>
				<p id="faq5" class="collapse">The planning application process has many components. The site is assessed as to its suitablility for appropriate development - residential, retirement, affordable, local needs, commericial or a mix of these. Ecologists, Highways, Topographical, Arboricultural and Archeological surveys may be required. SGJ works with a Masterplanner, Architects, Planning Consultant, the local Parish Council and District Council to create the most suitable scheme with the highest chance of success.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
				<hr  class="line green3">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq6" href="#faq6">How long does the whole process take?</a>
				<p id="faq6" class="collapse">At least a year and probably two. Whilst we pride ourselves with a friendly, efficient service, planning is not a quick process! A planning application takes a minimum of 3 months to prepare properly, and with many professionals to liaise with it can take longer. Once an application has been submitted, the council has up to 13 weeks to reply and this process may take longer if revisions are required, or if an appeal is required. Once planning has been obtained a sale usually takes a further 6 months to complete.</p>

				<hr class="line green2">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq7" href="#faq7">What are the costs of promoting my land?</a>
				<p id="faq7" class="collapse">The costs of achieving planning can vary between Â£50,000 to Â£250,000 or more depending on the size and complexity of the site. A typical residential site of 5 acres can cost a developer between Â£100,000 and Â£150,000. SGJ provides its own services for free and uses its own funds to pay for the planning process and application. The direct costs of the application are deducted from any subsequent sale, and the proceeds shared with the landowner who normally retains around 75%.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq8" href="#faq8">Is it expensive to develop the land myself?</a>
				<p id="faq8" class="collapse">Undoubtedly, yes! In addition to the large pre-application planning costs it can cost several million pounds to build houses and the associated infrastructure (roads, utilities, drainage, etc). In addition their are Local Authority costs such as Section 106 Payments, the CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) and Highway Improvements. It is an expensive business and that is why it is best to use a well funded developer such as SGJ.</p>

				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq9" href="#faq9">Can SGJ promote my land?</a>
				<p id="faq9" class="collapse">We would welcome the chance to speak to you confidentially about your land and give you our thoughts on it's potential. We deal with land all over the south of England, from Devon to Kent, and especially around our home county of Oxfordshire. Some land promoters will only deal with sites of ten acres or more but we are happy to talk to you only if you have one acre - maybe even less! Phone our office on 01869-244774 and speak to Andrew.</p>

				<hr class="line green2">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq10" href="#faq10">Why use SGJ to promote my land?</a>
				<p id="faq10" class="collapse">You only get one chance to sell your land and so it is best to let the experts help to maximise the value. SGJ hires the best consultants and are not reliant on an in-house team. We pride ourselves on being efficient, communicative and tenacious. SGJ will takes all the risk, does all the work and pays all the fees. If you do not have the knowledge or the funds or want to take the risk yourself, then it makes sense to employ SGJ to maximise your opportunity. As a partner with a share in the final sale proceeds it is in our interests to minimise the risk and maximise the potential, in the shortest time possible.</p>

				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq11" href="#faq11">Who pays for the work SGJ does?</a>
				<p id="faq11" class="collapse">SGJ uses its own funds to manage and pay for all aspects of the planning process and application. Working as a partner with the landowner it takes a share of the proceeds at the end of the successful sale of the land. Whilst a standard Land Promotion agreement returns 70% to the landowner, SGJ returns 75% and will also help advise on VAT and Tax issues. SGJ will also pay for the Landowner's reasonable legal expenses.</p>

				<hr  class="line green3">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq12" href="#faq12">Is NOW a good time?</a>
				<p id="faq12" class="collapse">The UK desperately needs to build more new homes and there is a growing appetite by the large house builders to secure land for future residential developments. Emerging Local Plans are therefore looking more favourably on designating land for development. Local Councils are increasingly putting out "Calls for Sites" whereby Landowners as asked to express their willingness for their land to be developed as part of a Neighbourhood Development Plan.</p>

				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq13" href="#faq13">Are there other Land Promoters?</a>
				<p id="faq13" class="collapse">Of course, other land promoters are available! Check how many projects they are working on, though. SGJ take on only a few projects at any one time, so that we can give our fullest attention to our current developments. Many promoters also have a development side of their business which can be a conflict of interest, or are aligned to just one or two house builders, effectively handing your site over to them. Most land promoters also charge 30% plus VAT, after expenses !</p>

			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq14" href="#faq14">Can I get a fee upfront?</a>
				<p id="faq14" class="collapse">In some cases, YES ! With larger plots of land, an pption fee can normally be agreed with a house builders. On smaller sites SGJ may pay a nominal upfront fee as a show of our commitment.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
				<hr  class="line green3">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq15" href="#faq15">What is an Option Agreement?</a>
				<p id="faq15" class="collapse">In an Option Agreement, the landowner enters into a formal agreement directly with a house-builder. The builder pays an upfront Option Fee in return for the right to buy the land at a specified time in the future, at price based on the value of the land once planning permission has been successfully obtained. If planning is not obtained then the land owner keeps the option fee AND retains the title to their land.</p>
			</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.4s">
				<hr class="line green2">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq16" href="#faq16">What are the advantages and disadvantages of an Option?</a>
				<p id="faq16" class="collapse">For larger sites there are advantages to having a large reputable builder already on board to help with the planning process, where the costs for planning can easily run away. There is also the opportunity to receive some money up front in return for a promotion commitment from the builder. On the downside it can be a slow process relying upon a large, busy house builder to handle the planning, all their costs will eventually be taken off from the sale proceeds, and they will be buying the land at an agreed discounted price to the â€˜open market valueâ€™ which is usually a good deal lower than the true open market value. SGJ can advise on this and has contacts with the land directors at most of the large UK house builders.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="0.8s">
				<hr  class="line blue">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq17" href="#faq17">What about Tax?</a>
				<p id="faq17" class="collapse">Any agreement must be carefully structured to ensure the most advantageous tax treatment for both parties. Invariably with large sums involved we always recommend the landowner seeks their own tax advice. There are situations where the sale of land is viewed by HMRC as free from CGT, such as where the land is part of the existing main residence. We can help recommend a good, specialist tax advisor familiar with such issues. Entrepreneurs Relief and Inheritance Tax are other potential considerations.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4 wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.2s">
				<hr  class="line green3">
				<a data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#faq18" href="#faq18">What about VAT?</a>
				<p id="faq18" class="collapse">Land is normally exempt from VAT, which means that VAT is not charged on the sale of land. However VAT can not be recovered on the costs incurred in promoting and selling the land. A land owner can "Opt to Tax" their land for VAT. This enables the land owner to reclaim VAT on any expenses incurred. VAT is then charged on the sale of the land, which is not an issue when dealing with a VAT registered builder.</p>
