      <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
      <h4 class="telephone">01869 244774</h4>
<p>SGJ is a family-owned property company specialising in identifying potential development land and promoting these sites for landowners. Based near Bicester in Oxfordshire we have over sixty years experience of securing sites and preparing planning applications for land we have bought and developed ourselves, and more recently for other landowners.</p>

<p>SGJ uses its own resources, expertise and team of skilled consultants in helping other landowners promote their land within the local development framework. We work as a partner alongside the landowner to secure planning that best maximises the value of their land, and then sell on the open market to developers and house-builders for the best price. Like the owner, SGJ takes a share of the proceeds at the end of any subsequent successful sale.</p>

<p>We understand that every landowner is different and has different needs and circumstances. Very often there are joint owners and families involved, and like any partnership good communication is key. We are we a friendly and professional company to work with, and we are very sensitive to each different landowner’s needs.</p>

<p>As a landowner you only get to sell your land once and it is therefore vital that we help you achieve the maximum value by identifying the most suitable development use and the most appropriate developers. We use our experience and expertise to make the land planning and selling process clear, transparent and straightforward.</p>

<p><strong>Kate Long</strong> – Kate worked as a commercial estate agent for five years before joining SGJ in 1995. She is a director of the business.</p>

<p><strong>Martyn Ellis</strong> – Martyn has been responsible for running the office and accounts since he joined ten years ago. </p>

<p><strong>Natasha Jewson</strong> – Natasha has a keen eye for identifying property and land and has been involved in the fittings & fixtures and interior design of houses.</p>

<p><strong>Stanley Jewson</strong> – Stanley still keeps an active role in the business he started. He has a wealth of experience in land and property development since he started his motor and property business back in the 1950s.</p>


<h3>LAND PROMOTION</h3>

<p>There are a number of different routes available to a landowner in order to promote their land for planning. They can either pay for and organise it themselves, or find a house-builder to take an option and do it, or they can find a developer to pay for and promote their land for them.</p>

<p>In a standard Land Promotion agreement with a developer, the developer will use their own resources and funds and expertise to pay for and manage the entire planning process. This can cost anywhere from £50,000 to £250,000+ depending on the size, nature and complexity of the site. For instance whether it is necessary for an application to go to appeal.</p>

<p>Any planning application will involve the use of consultants and experts in many different disciplines including, but not limited to: planning, architecture, highways, masterplanning, landscape architecture, ecology, topology, flooding, soil, contamination, trees, and of course lawyers and also accountants for tax-planning, as well as dealing with the local Parish Council and the regional District Council.  </p>

<p>SGJ has sixty years experience of dealing with the planning process, which has become ever more complex, expensive and time-consuming. SGJ is self-funded and uses its own expertise, resources, money and list of specialised consultants to help a landowner achieve the best planning on their land, in return for a share of the proceeds in any successful sale.</p>

<p>For larger sites, it may be possible to have an Option agreement direct with a house-builder. SGJ has contacts with the land directors at most of the UK’s largest house-builders. Barratt Homes, David Wilson, Berkeley Homes, Cala Homes, McCarthy & Stone, Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon to name a few. Where suitable we can find a large house-builder to take an Option on the land.</p>

<p>With an Option agreement, the landowner enters into a formal agreement to give that house-builder a right to buy their land once it has obtained planning, for a price based on the value of the land with planning permission. For the landowner there is the opportunity to receive some money up front in return for a promotion commitment from the developer. The developer, on the other hand, secures land that is usually of strategic benefit, at a price which is discounted against market value.</p>









<h3>FAQ</h3>


<p>What is Land Promotion? </p>
<p>What does a Land Promoter do?</p>
<p>How do you promote land?</p>

<p><span class="question">Is my land suitable for development?</span>
<br><span class="answer">There are lots of different factors that can affect suitability.</span>
<br>Apart from the obvious location and size, and the nature of the surrounding area, these also include whether the land is in Greenbelt, or if it is in flood plain. SGJ can advise you about your land.</p>

<p>What is my land worth? – Land values can vary from £250,000 per acre to over £1m an acre depending on location, suitability and use.</p>

<p>Who are SGJ? – SGJ is a fully independent family-owned and run property company specialising in identifying potential development land and promoting these sites for the landowners. We have over sixty years experience of securing sites and preparing planning applications and selling land to developers. Whilst we do still buy land ourselves we keep this separate from land we are promoting for other landowners. </p>

<p>How do you get Planning? – First the land is formally assessed by our planning consultants as to suitability for development, and what type of development, whether residential or retirement, affordable, commercial or a mix. Ecologists will check for wildlife including newts, badgers and bats. Highways will advise on access. Soil specialists need to assess the type of substructure and check for contamination. Topologist will map a detailed plan of the land including heights. A flood-risk assessment needs to be carried out and trees checked for any TPOs. Meanwhile SGJ will start liaising with all the different parties, the masterplanner, architect, planning consultant, local parish council, regional district council and sometimes also a landscape architect to create the most suitable scheme for the planning application. Finally the application along with all the information in a Design and Access Statement, and a fee (based on the number of houses) can be submitted.</p>

<p>How long does the whole process take? – At least a year and sometimes nearer two. Whilst we pride ourselves with a proactive and efficient service here at SGJ, it is not a quick process. A planning application takes a minimum of 3 to 4 months to prepare properly, and with so many different professionals to liaise with it can take longer. Once the application is submitted the council has up to 3 months to reply; and then it will take longer if revisions are required, or if ultimately an appeal is required. Once planning has been obtained a sale usually takes a further 3 to 6 months to complete. Realistically you should assume that from contacting SGJ to receiving payment for your land it would take 12-15 months at best and could take closer to 2 years.</p>

<p>What are the costs of promoting my land? – The costs to achieve planning can vary between £50,000 to £250,000 or more depending on the size and complexity of the site. A typical residential site of 5 acres would cost the developer between £100,000 and £150,000. SGJ provides its services free of charge and uses its own funds to pay for the planning process and application. The direct costs of the application are deducted from any subsequent sale, and the proceeds shared, with the landowner retaining 75%.</p>

<p>Is it expensive to develop the land myself? – Undoubtedly yes. In addition to the large planning costs it would cost several million pounds to build the houses and infrastructure in addition to the associated costs to Local Authority such as Section 106 Payments, the CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) and road improvements. It is an expensive business and that is why it is best to try and deal with a developer such as SGJ from the outset.</p>

<p>Why use SGJ to promote my land? – You only get one chance to sell your land. If you do not have the knowledge or the funds or want to take the risk yourself, then it makes sense to employ specialists to maximise your opportunity. SGJ will take all the risk, do all the work, and pay all the fees, all with your approval. As a partner with a share in the final sale proceeds it is in our interest to minimise the risk by employing the best consultants, maximise the planning available, and sell for the highest price to the most suitable house-builder, in the shortest time possible. </p>

<p>Who pays for the work SGJ does? – SGJ uses its own funds to manage and pay for all aspects of the planning process and application. Working as a partner with the landowner it takes a share of the proceeds at the end on successful sale of the land. Whilst a standard Land Promotion agreement returns 70% to the landowner, SGJ returns 75% and will also help advise on VAT and Tax issues.</p>

<p>Are there other Land Promoters? - Other land promoters are available, but do check how many projects they take on (SGJ take on no more than ten at any time) and whether they have a development side of the business (this can be a conflict of interest) or whether they are aligned to any one house-builder (we do a marketing campaign to all the house-builders). Most land promoters charge 30% of the final fee, plus VAT if this has not been properly planned.</p>

<p>Can I get a fee upfront? – In some cases with larger plots of land, and with Option agreements with house-builders, it is not unusual to be offered a nominal upfront fee from the promoter as a further show of commitment.</p>

<p>What is an Option Agreement? – In an Option Agreement, the landowner enters into a formal agreement directly with a house-builder to give them a right to buy their land at a specified time in the future, for a price based on the value of the land once planning permission has been successfully obtained. </p>

<p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of an Option? - For larger sites there are advantages to having a large reputable builder already on board to help with the planning process, and where the costs for planning can run away. There is also the opportunity to receive some money up front in return for a promotion commitment from the builder. On the downside it can be a slower process relying on busy house-builder to handle the planning, all their costs will eventually be taken off from the sale proceeds, and they will be buying the land at a stated discounted price to a defined ‘open market value’ which is usually a good deal lower than the true open market value that could be achieved. SGJ can advise on this and has contacts with the land directors at most of the large house-builders in the UK.</p>

What is the Local plan?
What is a Neighbourhood Plan?
What is the 5-Year Land Supply?
What is sustainable development?

<p>What about tax? - Any agreement must be carefully structured to ensure the most advantageous tax treatment for both parties. Invariably with large sums involved we always recommend the landowner seeks tax advice. There are situations where a sale of land is viewed by HMR&C as free from CGT. This includes where the land is part of the existing house, which is the main residence, and the land forms part of what can be justified as the normal bounds of the house. The devil as ever is in the details, which is why a specialist tax advisor should always be sought. We can help recommend a good tax advisor familiar with these issues. Entrepreneurs relief and inheritance tax are other tax considerations. </p>

<p>What about VAT? - Land is ordinarily exempt for VAT purposes which means that VAT is not charged on any sale of land. However VAT can not be recovered on any costs incurred on the land e.g. the land promotion costs. SGJ like most businesses is registered for VAT and so charge on LP but not on a JV.

<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>LAND PROMOTION </h3>

<p>SGJ is increasingly more involved in identifying strategic off-market land that has potential for residential development. Working with the landowners, this can be by way of either outright purchase, or an option agreement. In an option agreement, an option fee is payable to the land-owner, and then SGJ either handles and pays for the planning process at its own risk within an agreed option period (usually two years), or works with another house-builder to promote the land. SGJ ensures the land-owner gets up to 75% of the full open market value of the land, which can be over £1 million per acre in certain parts of the country.</p>

<p>TEST2 With a motoring history to the business, SGJ has kept in the motor trade, and for the last 30 years been specialising in the restoration of classic cars, particularly old Jaguars and Ferraris. With the phenomenal increase in classic car prices over the last eight years Andrew says he always knew he should have held on to that 1967 Jaguar E-Type, 1984 Ferrari GTO and aluminium 1965 275 GTB. He is still waiting for prices to come down again…</p>
