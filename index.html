<p>The company dates back to 1955 when Stanley Jewson and his brother started developing properties in Oxford whilst at the same time building up the Luxicars and Motorworld car dealerships. In 1984 they sold the Oxford Garage Group motor business (franchises included VW, Audi, Volvo, Saab, Renault, and BMW) to the Co-op whilst retaining the commercial premises they had built and developed. </p>

<p>Since 1984 the brothers continued developing properties, both commercial and residential, and in 1991 the name was changed to SGJ when Stanley went on his own to work with his accountant son Andrew and estate-agent daughter Kate. As well as properties and land in Oxfordshire, SGJ has been involved in schemes in Gloucestershire and the Home Counties, as well as overseas in places including Spain and Turkey (it was the first developer to get Savills to market houses it had built in Turkey).</p>

Last year it sold a large site in Oxford it owned and had developed, which had a mix of residential and commercial units, to a local college. It also has a few smaller properties and sites it is currently seeking to gain planning on. </p>
